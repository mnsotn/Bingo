This is a simple bingo game.  There are 2 roles:
1) Caller
2) Player

There are two modes of play:
1) Standard
2) Blackout

There are 5 ways to get a bingo:
A full row
A full column
The upper-left-to-lower-right diagonal
The lower-left-to-upper-right diagonal
Four corners

Blackout: all spaces on your card are covered.

If you're the caller, pick a ball with the "Pick a ball" button.  A box will appear with the ball info (e.g., G 59) that you can call out, and the corresponding square is filled in in the big grid.  The other buttons are self-explanatory.  "Create a card" creates a card for just you.

If you're not the caller, select/deselect a cell with a click/tap.  Your card will be checked after every selection for a bingo or blackout.

When changing games between standard bingo and blackout, your card (and the calling board) will be reset.
